### üìà [Project 2: Hospitality Regional Sales Analysis.
**Tools:** Tableau, SQL, Excel 

Week-on-Week (WoW) is a type of business metric that measures changes in a specific variable 
over a period of one week compared to the previous week. It is a common way of tracking 
business performance over time and is particularly useful for analyzing trends and identifying 
areas where improvements can be made. 
Here are the metrics for which we found the WoW change% in this video: 
1. Revenue WoW change %: To get the revenue change percentage week over week. 
2. Occupancy WoW change %: To get the occupancy change percentage week over week. 
3. ADR WoW change %: To get the ADR (Average Daily rate) change percentage week over 
week. 
4. RevPAR WoW change %: To get the RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room) change 
percentage week over week. 
5. Realisation WoW change %: To get the Realisation change percentage week over week. 
6. DSRN WoW change %: To get the DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) change percentage 
week over week. 
Let‚Äôs understand WoW change% for Revenue metric as an example: 
Let‚Äôs break down this formula: 

`Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]), SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn])) `

This line creates a variable named selv. It checks if there is only one filter applied to the 
dim_date[wn] column. If there is only one filter, it uses the selected value of that filter; 
otherwise, it uses the maximum value of the dim_date[wn] column. 

`var revcw = CALCULATE([Revenue],dim_date[wn]= selv) `

This line creates a variable named revcw. It calculates the revenue by applying a filter on the 
dim_date[wn] column, where the value matches the one stored in the selv variable. The 
[Revenue] measure is used for this calculation. 

`Var revpw = CALCULATE([Revenue],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1)) `

This line creates a variable named revpw. It calculates the revenue for the previous week by 
applying a filter on the dim_date[wn] column, where the value is one less than the one stored in 
the selv variable. The FILTER function combined with ALL(dim_date) ensures that the filter is 
applied to all the dates, regardless of other filters that might be active. The [Revenue] measure 
is used for this calculation. 

`DIVIDE (revcw, revpw,0)-1 `

This line calculates the percentage change in revenue WoW. It uses the DIVIDE function to divide 
the value of revcw (current week revenue) by the value of revpw (previous week revenue), with 
a specified default value of 0 in case the divisor is 0. The resulting quotient is then subtracted by 
1 to calculate the percentage change. 

The entire formula returns the week-over-week percentage change in revenue. This formula can 
be used as a calculated column or a measure in Power BI to display the WoW revenue change in 
a visual or table.
